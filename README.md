# Day-Calendar

## Bootcamp homework #5

An employee requires a responsive work day planner for scheduling tasks. The following "Acceptance Criteria" for this feature were requested and have now been implemented:

- When the work day scheduler is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
- Scrolling down the page presents time blocks for standard business day hours (8:00 a.m. -- 5:00 p.m.).
- These time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether that hour is in the past, the present, or the future (based on predefined CSS color schemes).
- Clicking on one of the time blocks enables the user to enter text.
- There is a "save" button adjacent to each time block. Clicking this button saves the entered text to local storage and displays it back inside the block.
- When the page is refreshed, all saved events persist.

Additionally, there are no errors in the console when it is inspected using Chrome DevTools and the Javascript includes comments.

## Work Day Scheduler webpage

The following is a screenshot of the webpage, highlighting its appearance and functionality:
